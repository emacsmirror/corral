* Corral
** What it is
A lightweight set of commands that enable you to quickly wrap parentheses, brackets, quotes, and other delimiters around text.

** What it isn't
A replacement to a fully-featured structural editing mode for lisp, like the built-in paredit.

** Examples
[[./corral-example-c.gif]] \\
[[./corral-example-el.gif]]

** Installation
Corral can be found on melpa, and should be installed from there.

** Usage
Call a command once to wrap the delimiters around the sexp at point.  Repeated calls of the same command, backward or forward, will shift the delimiters in the respective direction, corralling more text.

To use these commands, just bind them to keys of your choosing.  Here are some example keybindings:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "M-9") 'corral-parentheses-backward)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-0") 'corral-parentheses-forward)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-[") 'corral-brackets-backward)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-]") 'corral-brackets-forward)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-\"") 'corral-double-quotes-backward)
#+END_SRC
